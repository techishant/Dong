# Dong
It is my own pong game made using pygame in python.

## Instructions:
This game is normal Pong Game with a Catch that the player needs to play from both the sides and maintain their balance.

`W` and `S` key to move left Player, Up and down respectively.
`Up arrow` and `Down arrow` to move right player, Up and Down Respectively.
`END KEY` can be used to reset the score.

In the code The left player is referred as Hero and the right player is referred as Devil, and I don't know why? So be carefull of confusions.

And, and! it encrypts the highScore so as to avoid the cheating.
